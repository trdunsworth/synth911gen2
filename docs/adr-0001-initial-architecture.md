# 0001-Initial Architecture and Technology Choices

- **Status:** Proposed
- **Date:** June 2024
- **Deciders:** Tony Dunsworth, Contributors
- **Technical Story:** Initial project setup and technology selection

## Context and Problem Statement

Synth911Gen2 needs to generate large, realistic synthetic 911 dispatch datasets efficiently, with support for extensibility and multiple interfaces.

## Decision Drivers

- Need for high-performance data generation
- Realism and configurability of output
- Community familiarity and extensibility

## Considered Options

- Python with Pandas and Faker
- Node.js with custom data generation
- Java with Spring Boot and custom logic

## Decision Outcome

**Chosen option:** Python with Pandas and Faker

- Well-supported libraries for data manipulation and fake data
- Community familiarity
- Rapid development and prototyping

### Positive Consequences

- Fast development
- Easy extensibility
- Large ecosystem

### Negative Consequences

- Python performance limits for extremely large datasets

## Pros and Cons of the Options

### Python with Pandas and Faker

- Good, because of rapid prototyping and strong libraries
- Good, because of community support
- Bad, because of Python's GIL and single-threaded performance

### Node.js with custom data generation

- Good, because of async performance
- Bad, because of less mature data libraries

### Java with Spring Boot

- Good, because of performance and scalability
- Bad, because of slower development and higher complexity
