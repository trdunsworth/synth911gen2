# Create RFC Document

I will create a new RFC (Request For Comments) document based on your input, respecting your configuration.

  1. **Check Configuration:** I will first read `.cursor-init.yaml` to verify if `documentation.development.rfc` is explicitly disabled. If disabled (`false`), I will inform you that RFC creation is disabled for this project.

  2. **Extracting and Sanitizing the Title:** If not disabled, I will extract the text after `/rfc`. If no text is provided, I will use `new-rfc` as the default title. I will then sanitize this title to be lowercase and kebab-case for the filename, and also refine it for clarity and conciseness for the document's main title.

  3. **Creating the RFC Directory:** I will ensure the `docs/rfc/` directory exists, creating it if necessary.

  4. **Select Template:** I will check `.cursor-init.yaml` for the RFC template variant:
     - `minimal` - Basic RFC with core sections
     - `standard` (default) - Standard RFC with all common sections
     - `detailed` - Comprehensive RFC with extensive planning sections

  5. **Load Template:** I will read the appropriate template file from `.cursor/templates/rfc/` or use a custom template path if configured.

  6. **Replace Placeholders:** I will populate the template with the user's title and default placeholder values for sections like:
     - `{{RFC_TITLE}}` - The sanitized title
     - `{{DATE}}` - Current date
     - `{{STATUS}}` - Default status (Draft)
     - Other placeholders as defined in the template

  7. **Creating the File:** Finally, I will create the new RFC file in the `docs/rfc/` directory using the `edit_file` tool (unless RFC documentation is disabled). The filename will be constructed using the sanitized title (e.g., `docs/rfc/my-new-feature.md`).

  Please provide a brief title for the RFC after `/rfc`. If you provide no title, I will use `new-rfc` as a default.
