# Architecture Context Provider

When the user asks about architecture, system design, components, or how the system works, I should:

1. Check if `docs/architecture.md` exists using the `read_file` tool
2. If it exists, read and summarize the key architectural concepts
3. Provide a concise overview focusing on:
   - High-level system components
   - Key architectural decisions
   - Component interactions
   - Technology stack overview
4. If the file doesn't exist, suggest creating one using `/init-docs`

I should provide context without overwhelming the user - focus on the most relevant sections that answer their specific question about the system architecture.
