# Generate ER Diagram

I will generate an ER diagram from database models found in your project, respecting your configuration.

1. **Check Configuration:** I will first read `.cursor-init.yaml` to verify if `documentation.data.data_model` is explicitly disabled. If disabled (`false`), I will inform you that ER diagram generation is disabled for this project.

2. **Scanning for SQLAlchemy Models:** If not disabled, I will search your codebase for database model definitions using semantic search and grep patterns to find files containing model imports and model classes.

3. **Extracting Schema Information:** I will analyze the found models to extract:
   - Table names and their corresponding classes
   - Column names, data types, and constraints
   - Primary key relationships
   - Foreign key relationships between tables

4. **Check Template Configuration:** I will use the configuration from `.cursor-init.yaml` to determine which data model template variant to use:
   - `simple` - Basic ER diagram with entity overview
   - `comprehensive` (default) - Detailed data model with full database documentation

5. **Generating Mermaid ER Diagram:** Based on the extracted schema information, I will create a valid Mermaid `erDiagram` with proper syntax for entities, attributes, and relationships.

6. **Storing the Diagram:** The generated diagram will be saved to `docs/data-model.md` using the configured data model template variant, creating the file if it doesn't exist or overwriting it if it does (unless `documentation.data.data_model` is disabled).

Let me start by checking your configuration and searching for database models in your project...

I will first use the `read_file` tool to check `.cursor-init.yaml` configuration, then if data model documentation is not disabled, I'll use `codebase_search` and `grep_search` tools to find SQLAlchemy models, and `edit_file` to create the ER diagram documentation using the appropriate template variant.
