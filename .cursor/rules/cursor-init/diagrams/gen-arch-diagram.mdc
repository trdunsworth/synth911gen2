# Generate Architecture Diagram

I will generate a system architecture diagram from your project's structure.

1. **Analyzing Project Structure:** I will examine your project's top-level directories to identify the main components and their roles.

2. **Component Classification:** I will classify each directory based on its name and contents:
   - Documentation directories (docs, documentation)
   - CLI/Command directories (cli, cmd, commands)
   - Template directories (templates, template)
   - Source code directories (src, source)
   - Frontend/UI directories (frontend, ui, web)
   - Backend directories (backend, server, app)
   - Database/Model directories (database, db, models)

3. **Generating Mermaid Architecture Diagram:** Based on the identified components, I will create a Mermaid `graph TD` (Top-Down) flowchart showing the main architectural components and their relationships.

4. **Suggesting Integration:** If `docs/architecture.md` exists, I will suggest adding the diagram to that file for better documentation.

Let me start by analyzing your project structure...

I will use the `list_dir` tool to examine the project structure, then use `edit_file` to create or suggest updates to architecture documentation.
