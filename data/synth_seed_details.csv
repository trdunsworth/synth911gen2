queue_time,288,7,-0.06,0,0.77,-2,1,-0.42,-1.78,NaN,NaN,"This column has a small number of unique values. For synthetic data, sample directly from the existing unique values, treating it as a discrete distribution: `np.random.choice(a=[-2, -1, 0, 1], size=...)` if these are the only observed values. If `0.0` is overwhelmingly dominant, consider a discrete distribution with a high probability for `0.0`."
dispatch_time,288,16,2.68,1,5.09,0,25,2.12,5.02,NaN,NaN,"This column appears to contain non-negative integer counts (Mean: 2.68, Std: 5.09). Recommend `np.random.poisson(lam=2.68, size=...)` for count data, or `np.random.randint(low=0, high=26, size=...)` for a uniform integer distribution within its observed range. Given the skewness, Poisson or a custom discrete distribution might be more appropriate than uniform."

Queue_Time,288,142,259.99,21.5,874.52,-176,12731,9.94,105.77,NaN,NaN,"This column is highly right-skewed and/or has high kurtosis. This suggests a non-normal distribution. Given the extreme skewness and presence of negative values, simple distributions like Exponential or Log-Normal may not fully capture its shape. For a rough approximation, `np.random.uniform(low=-176.00, high=12731.00, size=...)` could be used, but this will not reflect the true distribution shape. For a more accurate representation, advanced statistical modeling using `scipy.stats` to fit a highly skewed distribution (e.g., a power-law-like distribution or a custom-fitted distribution) is recommended. If negative values are indeed errors, they should be cleaned first."
